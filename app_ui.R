    Our first approach is the relationship between GDP and Education. 
    In the graphical representation,we clearly see that with a higher level of income, 
    people tend to hold a higher education degree. We can interpret based on this. 
    With a low education degree, without the equivalent knowledge, 
    people cannot apply for a high-income job. Without a  high-income job, 
    he/she cannot afford tertiary education, and so on. To sum up, education level
    is proportional to GDP/capita"),

    an overall decreasing pattern for most, if not all countries in the world,
    meaning that in general, there are more available educational resources
    for more people to gain access to education. However, we also see a
    decreasing rate of change, so we might be facing a bottleneck period
    where most available resources were already distributed or it might be
    harder to spread the resouces further into the communities. When we explore
    the correlation of No Education Rate between various socialeconomic
    factors. Not surprisingly, Democracy and Income per Person have a pretty
    strong negative correlation with No Education Rate, meaning that a higher
    democracy index and a higher Income per person would lead to more people
    having access to education. And the Gini Index, a measure of income
    inequality, has a strong correlation with No Education Rate, meaning that
    the larger the income gap is, the more people with no access to education.
    This might be a train of thought for eliminating illiteracy, that we
    could probably take the first step to reduce the income gap."),

      demonstrate the normal distribution. There are two plots to show that. The first layer of the above plot is a density histogram. 
      The second layer is a statistical function â€“ the density of the normal curve, dnorm.
      We specify that we want the curve to have the same mean and standard deviation as the column of monthly income to show the trend 
      of normal distribution. For the second plot, we make function to make seven single plots generated from a normal distribution
      to compare the real data plot's trend (top left corner). We use stat_qq_line() which add in function to add a diagonal reference line to the plot, 
      which shows us where our points would fall if the data were perfectly normal. In short, the points more close to the black line, meaning the plot more
      close to the normal distribution. As we found, the overall trend of people's monthly income is left skewed, but for the higher educational level,
      more percentage of people get higher income."),
